# Graph-Based Processing for COMP9444 Project 21
Thr processing step includes:

Building co-occurrence graphs to capture word relationships.
Merging consecutive words based on their edge weight in the graph to capture multi-word expressions.
Removing stopwords to clean the data.
These preprocessing steps aim to enhance the models' understanding of linguistic nuances and improve emotion classification performance.
